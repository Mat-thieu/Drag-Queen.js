# Drag-Queen.js
**This is merely a small element dragging script which isn't currently being any developed further**

The intention was to create a full-fledged drag and drop library to compete with the (scarce amount of) other drag and drop libraries.
I found out it's a pretty tedious task to create a good drag and drop library so I might come back to this later.

Finished alternatives
[jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) (Requires jQuery as a dependency).
[Interact JS](http://interactjs.io/) (No dependencies but I personally had some trouble with this one, you might have more luck)
[Dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) (No dependencies, looks good, well documented)

Make an element draggable
```javascript
// Only works with ids at the moment.
dragqueen('#element');
```
